# Image-Sorter

This Script and Trained model helps you to filter your WhatsApp and Images folder from the photos of family and tourist places that you actually need vs the memes and random good morning and merry christmas / Happy diwali posts you get from lot of your family members or any places and apps.


## Current Implementation

- It includes a CNN trained over my private images with 300 Training Images and 42 Test Images
- The model was trained on a MacBook therefore it currently lacks GPU support; but will be updated soon


## Future Improvements
- Move from Notebook to python file
- Try to gather some more training data and train the model more with more evaluation matrices
- Try to make an API and a client so that people can do it from anywhere


Please feel free to reach out to me incase you face any trouble regarding the working
